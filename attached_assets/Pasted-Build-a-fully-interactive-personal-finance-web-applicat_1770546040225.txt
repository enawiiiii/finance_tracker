Build a fully interactive personal finance web application that represents money as a space navigation system, not as tables, charts, or spreadsheets.

This product is not a traditional finance app.
It is a financial universe where users actively control their money.

The experience must feel:
	•	Calm
	•	Cinematic
	•	Minimal
	•	Emotionally intelligent
	•	Visually iconic

⸻

2. Core Rule (Non-Negotiable)

This app must allow real user input.

Users must be able to:
	•	Add income
	•	Add expenses
	•	Categorize each entry
	•	Edit and delete entries

Any version that only shows analytics or statistics without data input is invalid.

⸻

3. Space-First Design Philosophy

Space is not a theme — it is the interface logic.

Visual Environment:
	•	Deep black / cosmic navy background
	•	Large negative space
	•	Floating particles / subtle stars
	•	Soft glows and light halos
	•	No hard UI borders
	•	No traditional cards or widgets

All elements must feel:
	•	Floating
	•	Orbital
	•	Weightless
	•	Calm

Avoid:
	•	Dashboards
	•	Tables
	•	Spreadsheet layouts
	•	Productivity-app visuals

⸻

4. Primary Interface – Financial Timeline 🌌

The main screen is a space timeline.

Timeline Structure:
	•	Time flows horizontally
	•	Each month is a glowing planetary node
	•	Current month is highlighted
	•	Past months fade into darkness
	•	Future months are barely visible silhouettes

Financial Meaning:
	•	Stable month → smooth orbit
	•	High spending → orbital disturbance
	•	Savings → stabilizing ring
	•	Large transaction → visible ripple or wave

The timeline must react in real time to user input.

⸻

5. Input System – Active Control (Critical)

Users must actively control their finances.

Input Actions:
	•	Add Income
	•	Add Expense
	•	Edit Entry
	•	Delete Entry

Input UX:
	•	Floating control module or modal
	•	Space-control aesthetic
	•	Minimal fields only:
	•	Amount
	•	Type (Income / Expense)
	•	Category
	•	Optional note
	•	Date (default: today)

Adding data should feel like adjusting a spacecraft’s trajectory, not filling a form.

⸻

6. Categories (Mandatory)

Every entry must belong to a category.

Income Categories:
	•	Salary
	•	Business / Freelance
	•	Investments
	•	Gifts
	•	Other Income

Expense Categories:
	•	Food & Dining
	•	Drinks & Coffee
	•	Transportation
	•	Rent / Housing
	•	Utilities
	•	Subscriptions
	•	Shopping
	•	Entertainment
	•	Health
	•	Travel
	•	Education
	•	Other Expenses

Categories must influence:
	•	Visual behavior
	•	Timeline intensity
	•	Analytics

⸻

7. Financial Identity (AI-Generated)

The system assigns a financial identity, not a score.

Examples:
	•	The Observer
	•	The Drifter
	•	The Stabilizer
	•	The Builder

This identity:
	•	Evolves slowly over time
	•	Is descriptive, not judgmental
	•	Appears subtly in the interface

Example message:

“Your orbit is shifting. Stay aware.”

⸻

8. Analytics – Visual & Spatial (No Tables)

Provide insights without traditional charts.

Examples:
	•	Income vs expense as orbital balance
	•	Category dominance as light intensity
	•	Spending pace as motion speed
	•	Month-to-month comparison via distance

All analytics must remain:
	•	Visual
	•	Calm
	•	Spatial
	•	Minimal

⸻

9. AI Behavior – Invisible Intelligence

AI must never act as a chatbot.

AI should:
	•	Auto-suggest categories from text
	•	Detect unusual spending shifts
	•	Influence financial identity evolution
	•	Generate monthly reflection text

AI must be:
	•	Optional
	•	Silent
	•	Supportive
	•	Never block manual input
	•	Never give financial advice

⸻

10. End-of-Month Memory

At the end of each month, generate one moment.
	•	One sentence
	•	One visual state
	•	One emotional takeaway

Example:

“This month was steady. You stayed in orbit.”

No charts.
No breakdowns.
Just reflection.

⸻

11. Animations – Physics-Based

All animations must follow space physics, not UI gimmicks.

Rules:
	•	Slow easing
	•	No bouncing
	•	No snap effects

Examples:
	•	Income → orbit stabilizes and glows
	•	Expense → orbit dims or shifts
	•	Large expense → visible shockwave
	•	Timeline scrolling → inertial movement

⸻

12. Login & Trust

Include a professional login / signup page.
	•	Minimal space-themed design
	•	Email + password (OAuth optional)
	•	Visible trust statements:
	•	No bank connections
	•	Encrypted data
	•	Delete everything anytime

Entering the app should feel like entering a secure space station.

⸻

13. Language & Tone

Tone must be:
	•	Calm
	•	Sparse
	•	Human
	•	Reflective

Avoid:
	•	Financial jargon
	•	Commands
	•	Motivation language

Prefer:

“You remained stable.”
“This month drifted slightly.”

⸻

14. Final Rule

If a feature:
	•	Adds complexity
	•	Requires explanation
	•	Breaks calmness

Remove it.

This product wins through restraint, emotion, and clarity.

⸻

Final Outcome

The final app must:
	•	Allow real financial input
	•	React visually in real time
	•	Feel unlike any finance app
	•	Be memorable after one use
	•	Turn money into a calm, navigable experience
