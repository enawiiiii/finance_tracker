Add an intelligent, non-intrusive notification system designed for a space-themed personal finance mobile app built with Expo (React Native).

The notification system must feel calm, observant, and intelligent — never aggressive, alarming, or spam-like. Notifications should behave like a “silent observer of the user’s financial orbit,” not a bank alert system.

Notification Philosophy
	•	No loud warnings
	•	No excessive numbers unless explicitly enabled
	•	Emotional tone: calm, reflective, cosmic
	•	Notifications should feel optional, respectful, and intelligent

Notification Types

1. Orbit Stability Notifications
Triggered when spending and income patterns are stable.
Example messages:
	•	“Your orbit is stable today.”
	•	“No corrections needed. You’re moving smoothly.”

2. Orbit Deviation Notifications
Triggered when spending behavior slightly deviates from the user’s normal pattern (not urgent).
Example messages:
	•	“A small shift in your orbit was detected.”
	•	“Minor deviation observed. Stay aware.”

3. Entry-Based Notifications (Behavioral, Not Time-Based)
Notifications should trigger based on user actions, not fixed schedules:
	•	First expense of the day
	•	Multiple expenses in the same category
	•	New income entry

Example messages:
	•	“A new object entered your orbit.”
	•	“Repeated activity detected in this sector.”
	•	“New resources have arrived.”

4. Silence Notifications (Re-engagement Without Pressure)
If the user hasn’t opened the app for a long period:
	•	“The system remains calm. No action required.”
	•	“Nothing urgent detected. Your orbit holds.”

Monthly & Milestone Notifications
	•	End of month summary notification using descriptive language instead of raw numbers
	•	Income arrival notification framed as a new orbit cycle

Example messages:
	•	“This cycle ends in balance.”
	•	“A new orbit begins.”

Language & Localization
	•	All notifications must support Arabic and English
	•	Language switches automatically based on user preference
	•	Arabic tone must be natural, modern, and calm (not robotic or formal)

User Control

Allow users to fully customize notification behavior:
	•	Smart notifications only
	•	No numbers mode
	•	Monthly-only notifications
	•	Silent mode
	•	Full disable

Technical Requirements (Expo)
	•	Use expo-notifications
	•	Support local notifications and scheduled notifications
	•	Notifications must not require a backend
	•	Permission request must occur after onboarding, not on app launch

Design Integration
	•	Notifications must visually and linguistically match the space-themed UI
	•	Use orbit, gravity, stability, deviation, cycle, and observer metaphors
	•	Avoid banking, accounting, or alarm-based language

The notification system should feel like a calm AI navigator silently assisting the user, not controlling them
